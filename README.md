# Flight2TheFutureCapstone
This project analyzes food insecurity, healthcare access, and disaster vulnerability across West Virginia to identify which counties would benefit most from drone-based delivery systems for food, medicine, and emergency supplies.
Using Python, Power BI, and geospatial tools, the project integrates:

USDA food desert tract data

Broadband access data (residential ≥25/3 Mbps)

FEMA National Risk Index (hazard + community resilience + expected losses)

County demographics

I developed a Drone Need Index (DNI) combining these indicators to highlight the counties facing the greatest access barriers. Results were visualized through interactive Power BI dashboards, county-level choropleth maps in Python, and a Google Earth Studio flight animation illustrating a sample drone route from Charleston to McDowell County.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data analytics can guide public policy, emergency planning, and future logistics technology—helping rural Appalachian communities overcome long-standing infrastructure gaps.
