# 🛩️ Flight to the Future: Predicting Drone Delivery Potential and Infrastructure Gaps for Critical Aid in Rural West Virginia
*A NewForce Data Analytics Capstone Project by Walter Lovett*

---

## 📌 Overview

**Flight to the Future** is a data analytics capstone project that examines how drone technology can bridge critical infrastructure gaps in rural West Virginia. By analyzing food access, healthcare shortages, disaster vulnerability, and terrain barriers, this project builds a **Drone Need Index (DNI)** that identifies where drone-assisted delivery would have the greatest humanitarian impact.

The project focuses on rural Appalachian communities—particularly those isolated by geography, limited broadband, medical provider shortages, and high food insecurity. The result is a data-driven roadmap for **where drones should fly first**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Identify the West Virginia counties with the **highest combined risk** using food access, healthcare shortages, and disaster loss estimates.  
- Build a **Drone Need Index (DNI)** to quantify and visualize priority areas.  
- Use **Power BI dashboards** to communicate access gaps and infrastructure weaknesses.  
- Create geospatial visualizations and a **simulated drone route** to demonstrate how drones bypass terrain barriers.  
- Provide actionable insights for nonprofits, emergency responders, and rural health organizations.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib)  
- **Power BI**  
- **Power Query**  
- **GIS & Geospatial Visualization**  
- **USDA Food Access Data**  
- **HRSA HPSA Healthcare Shortage Data**  
- **FEMA Estimated Annual Loss (EAL)**  
- **Google Earth Studio** (drone route animation)  
- **GitHub** for version control

## 📊 Key Visuals & Analysis Components

### 1. Risk Matrix

A ranked table displaying:

- Food Desert Tracts  
- Medical Need Index (MNI)  
- Estimated Annual Loss (EAL)  
- Composite Risk Score  

Sorted from highest to lowest vulnerability.

---

### 2. Drone Need Index Map

A combined metric built from:

- Food Access  
- Medical Need Index  
- Disaster Exposure (EAL)  
- Geographic isolation  

This map highlights **where drones can make the greatest impact first**.

---

### 3. TreeMap of Risk Levels

Color-coded:

- **Red** = High Risk  
- **Yellow** = Medium Risk  
- **Green** = Low Risk  
- **Blue** = Non-food-desert counties  

Provides an intuitive snapshot of statewide need.

---

### 4. Healthcare Shortage Visualization

A bar chart showing the **Top 10 medical shortage sites** (HPSA areas), including FCI McDowell and FCI Gilmer, demonstrating severe provider shortages in the highest-risk counties.

---

### 5. Drone Route Animation

A 26-second simulated drone flight created in Google Earth Studio showing a delivery route from Charleston to Iaeger.  
Demonstrates how drones can bypass terrain barriers and reduce emergency delivery times.

## 🛰️ Why Drones?

Rural Appalachian communities face:

- Limited broadband  
- Physician shortages  
- High food insecurity  
- Disaster-prone terrain  
- Long distances to care  

Drones offer a scalable way to:

- Deliver medications  
- Reach isolated homes  
- Support food distribution  
- Improve emergency response times  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
2. **Transformation in Power Query**  
3. **Normalization of HPSA → Medical Need Index (MNI)**  
4. **Building the Drone Need Index (DNI)**  
5. **Power BI & Python visualizations**  
6. **Route simulation using Google Earth Studio**

---

## 🧭 Insights & Takeaways

- McDowell, Kanawha, and Logan show the **highest combined need**.  
- The Drone Need Index strongly aligns with food insecurity and healthcare shortages.  
- Drones could significantly reduce emergency delivery times in high-risk areas.  
- The project provides a humanitarian roadmap for drone-assisted logistics.
